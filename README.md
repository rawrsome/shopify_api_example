Also, feel free to include any CSS or Javascript frameworks and libraries. Bootstrap, jQuery, and AngularJS CDNs have been provided for you - using AngularJS is encouraged!

###Core Requirements
* Display at least 12 products on the page using a grid layout view ( [example](https://www.100percentpure.com/collections/soaps) ).
make sure to display the product title, image, and price at a minimum.

* Style your page. We are looking for clean modern aesthetics, use your best judgement!

* We are looking for well commented and modular code. Following an architectural pattern is recommended (i.e. Object Oriented, Promise Pattern, etc).

###Extra Points
* The Shopify API provides a lot of information besides the 4 core categories listed above, make use of the other categories to display a quick view of all product info. (e.g. displaying product description info )
 
* Creative implementation of displaying product inventory. 

* Implement pagination to display all products.

* jQuery/CSS animation techniques. (for front end positions)
